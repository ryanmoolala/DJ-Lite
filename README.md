Background:
DJ-Lite is a full stack web application that I decided to create during the summer of 2024, Spotify being the core idea since I like music. 

Most analysers out there commonly utilise Python (Flask or Django) or JavaScript (NodeJS) to serve as a backend language, thus I decided to deviate from that by choosing Java, and the Spring framework. Moreover, having just learnt CS2030S (A Java module IN NUS Computing) will allow me to exercise my skills and knowledge even further. 

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS

Backend: Java, Spring 

Database: MongoDB
